# JUST-DO-IT-encoder-decoder

# Introduction:
Assalam-O-Alaikum!

(Peace be upon you)

<b>JUST DO IT</b> is an encoder/decoder that currently supports automatic+manual HTML and URL encoding/decoding but I will try to add other types of encodings that will help bug-hunters/hackers(and ofc anybody) to quickly encode/decode their payloads or whatever they want to for security testing or maybe something different.

#### Features
The main features of this tool are given below:

1. ###### Automatic HTML encoding/decoding
It means you only need to enter a value and it will automatically detect and decode, encoded string and vice versa

2. ###### Automatic UTL Encoding/Decoding
This program now supports automatic URL encoding it means you only need to enter a value and if it is already encoded it will decode it and vice versa.

3. ###### Manual HTML Encoding/Decoding
If you don't like automatic encoder then no worry, it also gives you the ability to manually encode/decode a string

4. ###### Manual URL Encoding/Decoding
It also supports manual URL encoding if you want to double,triple encode a string
