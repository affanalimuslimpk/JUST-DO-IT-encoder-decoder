# JUST-DO-IT-encoder-decoder

# Introduction:
JUST DO IT is an encoder/decoder that currently supports HTML encoding but I will try to expand add type of encodings that
will help bug hunters/hackers to quickly encode/decode strings for security testing.

#### Features
The main features of this tool are given below:

1. ###### Automatic HTML encoding/decoding
Its mean you only need to enter a value and it will automatically detect and decode, encoded string and vice versa

2. ###### Manual HTML Encoding/Decoding
If you don't like automatic encoder then no worry, it also gives you the ability to manually encode/decode a string

<code>git clone https://github.com/muslimfrompk/JUST-DO-IT-encoder-decoder.git</code>
